## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Overview

This project uses **Prisma** with a **PostgreSQL** database. Main models:

- **User**: Authentication, owns tasks, collections, and labels.
- **Task**: Belongs to a user, can be linked to a collection, have labels, and extra metadata.
- **Collection**: Groups tasks for a user, can have a color.
- **Label**: User-defined tags for tasks, can have a color.
- **Extras**: Optional metadata for a task (due date, priority, extra labels).

### Key Relationships

- A **User** has many **Tasks**, **Collections**, and **Labels**.
- A **Task** belongs to one **User**, can belong to one **Collection**, and have many **Labels**.
- **Labels** can be attached to many **Tasks** (many-to-many).
- **Extras** is a one-to-one extension of **Task** for due date, priority, and extra labels.

### Enums

- **Status**: `TODO`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `DONE`
- **PriorityLevel**: `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`, `URGENT`
